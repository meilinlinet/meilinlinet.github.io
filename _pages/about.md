Welcome to my website!

I am a PH.D candidate majoring political science at University of North Texas. I study international relations and comparative politics. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of international relations and comparative politics, with a paticular focus on leaders' foreign policy choices, public diplomacy, and interstate conflict. I examine how leaders shape and respond to economic challenges, the strategic role of public diplomacy during conflicts, and the broader economic influence of foreign capital in developing countries. 

If you are interested in my working papers please feel free to contact me: [MeilinLi@my.unt.edu](mailto:MeilinLi@my.unt.edu)
