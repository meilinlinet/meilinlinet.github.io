I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of North Texas (UNT). I study international relations and comparative politics. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of international relations and comparative politics, with a particular focus on leadersâ€™ foreign policy decisions, political economy, and interstate conflict. I examine how leaders shape and respond to economic challenges, the strategic role of public diplomacy during conflicts, and the broader economic influence of foreign capital in developing countries.
